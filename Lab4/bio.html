                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Born in the time of the dinosaurs, Yiyiyoyo was known as a caveman.
                He trained velociraptors like there were dogs, used pterodactyls as planes and 
                battles the Tyrannosauras Rex. He truly lived a happy life with no school nothing,
                just pure bliss every single day. A few years went by, and Yiyiyoyo saw the 
                extinction of the dinosaurs, he didn't die because he lived in what was known at the 
                time called Asia.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Millions of years went by and he saw the evolution of homo sapiens into 
                the true hulks of the ice age. He stalked and watched these people hunt down mammoths
                and battle sabertooths. Everything was a movie, everything he did was for his own 
                enjoyment, and in the end... these people died off as well.

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At least in the end, he got to see the history of the Egyptians, Vikings,
                Greens, Romans, and the rise and fall of empires all around the world. But this all 
                occurred in the blink of an eye to him. He's been gone for the last hundred years, and 
                rumor has it that, he'll appear soon again, and watch history unfold for the next millions 
                of years.
